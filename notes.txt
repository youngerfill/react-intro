v add history

. add proposed features at the end of the tutorial:

    If you have extra time or want to practice your new React skills, here are some ideas for improvements that you could make to the tic-tac-toe game which are listed in order of increasing difficulty:

        v 1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
            --> added a "value" item to the buttons too

        v 2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
        v 3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
            --> tedious because loops are not allowed inside JSX code

        v 4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
        v 5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
        v 6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

. Split code into modules

v add module react-hyperscript-helpers
    . Rewrite JSX with hs helper functions.
    v are loops allowed in render method when using HS?
        --> no

            "Think of it like you're just calling JavaScript functions. You can't put a for loop inside a function call:
            return tbody(
                for (var i = 0; i < numrows; i++) {
                        ObjectRow()
                            } 
                            )"

x add a "start a new game" button

. split up index.js into modules?
